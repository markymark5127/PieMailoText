silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface in mind for this project

Which can be installed by running these commands:
git clone https://github.com/silvanmelchior/RPi_Cam_Web_Interface.git  
cd RPi_Cam_Web_Interface  
chmod u+x *.sh  
./install.sh 
*sometimes motion detection doesnt start on this application I added in the line "motion -n" for it to work for me*

You can add in this alert message you can point to for motion detection to send you a text message for response

if you have this in your pi/home dir then add the line "/home/pi/alert.py"
